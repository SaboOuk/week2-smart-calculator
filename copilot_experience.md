# My GitHub Copilot Experience - Week 2
## What Worked Well
[List 3-5 things Copilot helped with]
- Example: Copilot completed the basic math operations perfectly
- Copilot helped me set up and configure the Python environment by suggesting how to create and select a virtual environment.

- It provided step-by-step guidance for running my calculator script (calculator_with_search.py) directly in the terminal.

- Copilot explained what each program option did, making it easier to understand how the user interface worked.

- It handled repetitive terminal prompts automatically, saving me time on manual setup.

- The instructions it generated made it simple to test the program’s different functions (basic math, equation solving, visualization, etc.).
## Challenges
[List 2-3 challenges you faced]
- Example: Sometimes Copilot suggested code I didn't understand
-Sometimes Copilot suggested setup steps that didn’t fully apply to my workspace, such as creating multiple environments.

-It occasionally repeated the same “Allow/Focus Terminal” prompts instead of advancing the code execution.

-I had to manually check which Python interpreter was active before running the script because Copilot didn’t always detect it correctly.
## Prompt Engineering Tips I Learned
[List 3-5 tips for better Copilot prompts]
- Example: Writing clear comments before functions helps Copilot understand what I want
-Writing detailed comments before asking Copilot to assist (for example, describing what kind of calculator or operation I want) gives more accurate suggestions.

-Keeping prompts short and focused helps prevent Copilot from giving unnecessary setup instructions.

-Using phrases like “run this Python program step by step” or “help me debug this error” makes Copilot respond in more structured ways.

-Providing context (e.g., telling Copilot what file or function I’m in) improves its accuracy.

-Asking clarifying follow-ups like “show me how this line works” helps me learn from its code suggestions.
## Code Copilot Generated
result = calc.basic_calculate(2, '+', 3) # -> 5
calc.visualize_search(12, '+', 5, x_position='left') # shows search steps for "x + 5 = 12"
## My Productivity Assessment
On a scale of 1-10, Copilot improved my coding speed by: [8]
Explanation: [2-3 sentences]
Copilot saved a lot of time by handling setup steps and reminding me of terminal commands I might have forgotten. It also made testing smoother because it walked me through how to interact with the calculator. While I still had to manage a few environment issues manually, overall, it made the process much faster and easier to follow
