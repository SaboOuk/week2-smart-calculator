# Smart Calculator with Search
## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Equation solver using search algorithms
- Visualization of search process
- Interactive menu system
## How Search Works in This Calculator
My calculator is a simple interactive program that handles basic math and simple equations. It uses a small set of functions for operations like add, subtract, multiply, divide, and power. The equation solver tries different values of x in small steps until both sides of the equation match, and it can show a few of the values it tests. It only works with basic inputs like “x + 5 = 10,” and it can be a little slow or miss answers if the steps are too big.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Run: `python calculator_with_search.py`
3. Follow the menu options
## Sample Equations to Try
- x + 5 = 10 (answer: 5)
- x * 3 = 21 (answer: 7)
- 100 - x = 75 (answer: 25)
## What I Learned About Search
From this project, I learned how a simple search algorithm can be used to find solutions by testing different values step by step. The brute-force approach in my calculator showed me how computers can “guess and check” until they reach an answer. I also realized how important the step size and range are — too large or too small can affect accuracy and speed. Even though it’s not the most efficient method, it helped me understand the basics of how search algorithms work behind the scenes.
